entity cannot reasonably verify that a request to ex-

(1)  Algorithm  impact  assessment.—
(A)	IMPACT	ASSESSMENT.—Notwith-
standing any other provision of law, not later
than 2 years after the date of enactment of this
Act, and annually thereafter, a large data hold-
er that uses an algorithm that may cause po-
tential harm to an individual, and uses such al-
gorithm solely or in part, to collect, process or
transfer covered data must conduct an impact
assessment	of	such	algorithm	in	accordance
with subparagraph (B).
(B) IMPACT ASSESSMENT SCOPE.—The im-
pact assessment required under subparagraph
(A) shall provide the following:
(i) A detailed description of the design
process	and	methodologies	of	the	algo-
rithm.

used by the algorithm, including the spe-
cific categories of data that will be proc-
essed as input and any data used to train
the model that the algorithm relies on.
(iv) A description of the outputs pro-
duced by the algorithm.

practices required under subsection (a) shall include, at
a minimum, the following practices:
(1)	ASSESS	VULNERABILITIES.—Identifying
and assessing any material internal and external
risk to, and vulnerability in, the security of each sys-
tem maintained by the covered entity that collects,
processes or transfers covered data, or service pro-
vider that collects, processes, or transfers covered
data on behalf of the covered entity, including unau-
thorized access to or risks to such covered data,
human vulnerabilities, access rights, and the use of
service providers. With respect to large data holders,

spond to unsolicited reports of vulnerabilities by any
entity or individual.

POSAL.—Disposing of covered data that is required

purpose for which the data was collected, processed
or transferred, unless an individual has provided af-
firmative express consent to such retention. Such
disposal shall include destroying, permanently eras-
ing, or otherwise modifying the covered data to
make such data permanently unreadable or indeci-
pherable and unrecoverable to ensure ongoing com-
pliance with this section.
(5) TRAINING.—Training each employee with

nologies, including blockchain and distributed ledger
technologies and other emerging technologies, are
used to secure covered data.
SEC. 302. SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THIRD PARTIES.
(a) SERVICE PROVIDERS.—A service provider—
(1) shall only collect, process, and transfer serv-
ice provider data to the extent strictly necessary and
proportionate to provide a service requested by the
covered entity. This paragraph shall not require a
service provider to collect or process covered data if
the service provider would not otherwise do so;
(2) shall not collect, process, or transfer service
provider data if the service provider has actual
knowledge that the covered entity violated this Act
with respect to such data;
(3) shall assist a covered entity in fulfilling the
covered entity’s obligation to respond to individual
rights requests pursuant to section 203, by appro-
priate technical and organizational measures, taking
into account the nature of the processing and the in-
formation reasonably available to the service pro-
vider;
(4) may engage another service provider for
purposes of processing service provider data on be-
half of a covered entity only after providing the cov-
ered entity that is directing the services or functions
of the service provider with respect to such service
provider data with notice, and pursuant to a written
contract that requires such other service provider to
satisfy the obligations of the service provider with
respect to such service provider data;
(5) shall upon the reasonable request of the
covered entity, make available to the covered entity
information necessary to demonstrate the service
provider’s compliance with the obligations in this
Act, which may include making available a report of
an independent assessment arranged by the service
provider on terms agreed to by the parties and mak-
ing the report required under section 207(c)(2) as
applicable;
(6) shall, at the covered entity’s direction, de-
lete or return all covered data to the covered entity
as requested at the end of the provision of services,
unless retention of the covered data is required by
law;
(7) shall not transfer service provider data to
any person with the exception of another service pro-
vider without the affirmative express consent, ob-
tained by the covered entity with the direct relation-
ship to the individual that is directing the services
or functions of the service provider with respect to
the service provider data, of the individual to whom
the service provider data is linked or reasonably
linkable;
(8) shall develop, implement, and maintain rea-
sonable administrative, technical, and physical safe-
guards that are designed to protect the security and
confidentiality of covered data it processes consistent
with section 208; and
(9) shall be exempt from the requirements of
section 202(d) with respect to service provider data
but shall provide direct notification regarding mate-
rial changes to its privacy policy to each covered en-
tity with which it provides services or functions as
a service provider, in each language that the privacy
policy is made available. Compliance with this provi-
sion does not alleviate any obligations the service
provider has to the covered entity to which it pro-
vides services or functions as a service provider.
(b) CONTRACTS BETWEEN COVERED ENTITIES AND
SERVICE PROVIDERS.—A person or entity may act as a
service provider pursuant to a written contract between
the covered entity and the service provider, or a written
contract between one service provider and a second service
provider as permitted in section 302(a)(4), provided that
the contract—
(1) governs the service provider’s data proc-
essing	procedures	with	respect	to	processing	or
transfer performed on behalf of the covered entity or
service provider;
(2) clearly sets forth—
(A) instructions for processing data;
(B) the nature and purpose of processing;
(C) the type of data subject to processing;
(D) the duration of processing; and
(E) the rights and obligations of both par-
ties; and
(3) does not relieve a covered entity or a service
provider of an obligation under this Act; and
(4) prohibits—
(A) collecting, processing, or transferring
covered data in contravention to subsection (a);
and
(B) combining service provider data with
covered data which the service provider receives
from or on behalf of another person or persons
or collects from its own interaction with an in-
dividual. The contract may, subject to agree-
ment with the service provider, permit a covered
entity to monitor the service provider’s compli-
ance with the contract through measures in-
cluding, but not limited to, ongoing manual re-
views and automated scans, and regular assess-
ments,	audits,	or	other	technical	and	oper-
ational testing at least once every 12 months.
(c)  RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN  COVERED  ENTITIES
and  Service  Providers.—
(1) Determining whether a person is acting as
a covered entity or service provider with respect to
a specific processing of data is a fact-based deter-
mination that depends upon the context in which
such data is processed.
(2) A covered entity or service provider that
transfers covered data to a service provider, in com-
pliance with the requirements of this Act, is not lia-
ble for a violation of this Act by the service provider
to whom such covered data was transferred, this Act
provided that, at the time of transferring such cov-
ered data, the covered entity or service provider did
not know or have reason to know that the service
provider would likely commit a violation of this Act.
